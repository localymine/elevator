# elevator
First there is an elevator class. 
It has a direction (up, down, stand, maintenance), 
a current floor and a list of floor requests sorted in the direction. 
Each elevator has a set of signals: Alarm, Door open, Door close

The scheduling will be like: 
if available pick a standing elevator for this floor. 
else pick an elevator moving to this floor. 
else pick a standing elevator on an other floor.

Sample data: 
- Elevator standing in first floor 
- Request from 6th floor go down to ground(first floor). 
- Request from 5th floor go up to 7th floor 
- Reuqest from 3rd floor go down to ground 
- Request from ground go up to 7th floor. 
- Floor 2 and 4 are in maintenance.

Plus: Making an API to send/receive requests to elevator and write log file.
